# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Python)

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** developed in **Python**, which suggests movies based on content similarity. It uses NLP techniques and cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to the one selected by the user.

## 🚀 Features

- Recommends movies based on content similarity
- Uses cosine similarity to find relevant matches
- User-friendly interface via command line
- Based on movie metadata like title, genre, keywords, etc.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for cosine similarity & vectorization)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 📁 File Structure

- `main.py` – Core logic of the recommendation engine
- `movies.csv` – Dataset containing movie metadata
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VineethaPadma/movie_recommendation.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📌 Use Cases

- Learning tool for beginners in Machine Learning and NLP
- Basis for building more advanced recommendation engines (collaborative filtering, deep learning, etc.)
- Useful for small-scale personal projects and academic demos

## 📊 Possible Improvements

- Add a GUI using Streamlit or Tkinter
- Include collaborative filtering
- Use a larger, more detailed dataset (e.g., from TMDb or IMDb)

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of a machine learning learning path. Inspired by common recommendation system architectures.
